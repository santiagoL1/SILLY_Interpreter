# SILLY_Interpreter
An interpreter for the SILLY programming language written in Javascript. An assignment completed for CSC 533 Programming Languages at Creighton University.

The SILLY Interpreter is a simple interpreter for a custom programming language, built in Java. It supports basic features like repeat loops, boolean operations (AND/OR/NOT), and string manipulation, with strings treated as lists of characters. The project uses inheritance to model different data types, such as strings and lists. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate key concepts of language interpretation and object-oriented design, including working with abstract classes and enums to define operations and data structures.
